Find the identical pairs

- Count of index pairs with equal elements in an array

- Given an array of n elements. The task is to count the total number of indices (i, j)
  	such that arr[i] = arr[j] and i != j

	Input : arr = {1, 1, 2}
	Output : 1
	As arr[0] = arr[1], the pair of indices is (0, 1)

	Input : arr = {1, 1, 1}
	Output : 3
	As arr[0] = arr[1], the pair of indices is (0, 1),
	(0, 2) and (1, 2)

	Input : arr = {1, 2, 3}
	Output : 0
