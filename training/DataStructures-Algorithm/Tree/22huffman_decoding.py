Input:
s="1001011"

Output:
ABACA

Explanation:

S="1001011"
Processing the string from left to right.
S[0]='1' : we move to the right child of the root. We encounter a leaf node with value 'A'.
We add 'A' to the decoded string.
We move back to the root.

S[1]='0' : we move to the left child.
S[2]='0' : we move to the left child. We encounter a leaf node with value 'B'.
We add 'B' to the decoded string.
We move back to the root.

S[3] = '1' : we move to the right child of the root. We encounter a leaf node with value 'A'.
We add 'A' to the decoded string.
We move back to the root.

S[4]='0' : we move to the left child.
S[5]='1' : we move to the right child. We encounter a leaf node with value C'.
We add 'C' to the decoded string.
We move back to the root.

 S[6] = '1' : we move to the right child of the root. We encounter a leaf node with value 'A'.
 We add 'A' to the decoded string.
We move back to the root.
